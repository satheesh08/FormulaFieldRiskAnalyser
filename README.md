## üß† Formula CPU Risk Analyzer for Salesforce

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) helps developers and admins proactively detect **complex formula fields** that may risk hitting **Apex CPU time limits**. It analyzes all formula fields on a specific object and calculates their:


| üîç Metric                         | üß† Meaning                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß¨ **Nesting depth**              | How deep the formula nesting is (e.g., nested `IF`, `AND`, `OR` logic). Deep nesting can hit CPU limits.                |
| üîó **Cross-object hops**          | How many relationships the formula travels across (`Account.Owner.Profile.Name` = 2 hops). More hops = more CPU.        |
| üß† **Heavy function count**       | Count of expensive functions like `ISCHANGED`, `PRIORVALUE`, `VLOOKUP`, `GEOLOCATION`, `DISTANCE`. These are CPU-heavy. |
| üî• **CPU risk level**             | Based on depth, hops, heavy functions, length, and unbalanced parentheses. (High / Medium / Low).                       |
| üí£ **Formula too long**           | Boolean flag if formula exceeds 3000 characters. Can impact performance.                                                |
| üßç **Uses \$User / \$RecordType** | Checks if formula references current user or record type ‚Äî often used in dynamic formulas.                              |
| üìà **CPU Score**                  | A numerical score derived from multiple factors to quantify complexity/risk.                                            |
| üö© **Red Flags**                  | Text field highlighting specific issues found, e.g., ‚ÄúExcessive nesting‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnbalanced parentheses‚Äù, etc.                |

It uses the **Tooling API** securely via a **Named Credential**, removing the need for manual token management.

## üíº Why It Matters
Salesforce formulas can silently contribute to performance bottlenecks, especially when:

üß¨ Nesting gets deep
Deeply nested IF, AND, or CASE statements increase evaluation complexity.

üîó Cross-object references are chained
Referencing multiple parent objects (e.g., Opportunity.Account.Owner.Profile.Name) increases data traversal and CPU usage.

üîÅ Used in multiple automations
When the same formula field is used in multiple Flows, validation rules, or process builders, it's recalculated multiple times.

üß† Contain heavy functions
Expensive functions like VLOOKUP, ISCHANGED, PRIORVALUE, DISTANCE, GEOLOCATION can cause spikes in CPU time.

üïµÔ∏è Used in record-triggered Flows or Apex
When formulas are accessed via triggers or flows, Salesforce recalculates them, impacting total transaction time.

üßÆ Used in List Views or Reports
Formula fields on frequently-used list views or report filters slow down loading and query times.

üß± Include hardcoded logic or IDs
Makes formulas brittle and harder to maintain, often leading to downstream logic errors or misfires.

üîÅ Have repeated expressions
Repeating the same logic multiple times within a formula increases processing cost unnecessarily.

üìÖ Use date/time logic excessively
Functions like NOW(), TODAY(), DATEVALUE() can recalculate on every view/load, increasing overhead.

üßæ Evaluated on large data volumes
In batch Apex or mass updates (e.g., data loads), formula fields contribute to CPU usage per record.

This tool surfaces those risks **before they become production incidents**.

## üß© Setup Instructions

### üîë STEP 1: Create a Connected App (One-Time Setup)

1. **Go to:**
   Setup ‚Üí **App Manager** ‚Üí **New Connected App**

2. **Fill in:**

   * **Name:** `ToolingAPI_ConnectedApp`
   * **API Name:** (auto-filled)
   * **Contact Email:** (your email)

3. ‚úÖ **Enable OAuth Settings:**

   * ‚òëÔ∏è Enable OAuth Settings
   * **Callback URL:**
     `https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/callback`
   * **Selected OAuth Scopes:**

     * `Access and manage your data (api)`
     * `Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_access)`
     * `Full access (full)`

4. Click **Save**.
   üîë Note the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**

> ‚è≥ Wait 2‚Äì10 minutes for it to become available.

---

### üåê STEP 2: Create an Auth Provider

1. Go to:
   Setup ‚Üí **Auth. Providers** ‚Üí **New**

2. **Provider Type:** `Salesforce`

3. Fill:

   * **Name:** `Salesforce_Tooling_Auth`
   * **Consumer Key:** from Connected App
